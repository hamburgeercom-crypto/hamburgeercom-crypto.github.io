    <h1>Cost vs Quality</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Strategy 1: Cost efficiency</h2>
      <div class="strategy">
        <p><span class="blank">Cost efficiency is the act of decreasing the cost of production. Cost efficiency can be achieved through decreasing cost of operations through automation with robots and computer programs, scaling up to more economies, outsourcing production/management to other companies and standardising contracts with specific partners are all steps which can be taken by companies to decrease costs</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">Lowering costs leads to higher profit margins and the ability to price products more competitively. This can lead to higher marketshares and share value improving the companies present and future gains.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The outcomes of lowering costs often involve decreasing corporate freedom, leading to less sourcing options, or lockin contracts which can eventually turn negative for the company. If production or management is outsourced, the outcome is not standardised potentially leading to unreliable products or data. Decreasing the cost of production through changing the product directly can also lead to a worse product which can be less valuable.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">In 2018, BHP standardised their employee contracts, leading to cost savings, however the decreased employee flexibility led to criticisms.</span></p>

      <h2>Strategy 2: Safety and environmental quality</h2>
      <div class="strategy">
        <p><span class="blank">Ways in which safety and environmental quality can be achieved are through advanced monitoring equipment and detailed training.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The benefits of increasing safety and environmental quality are improving employee welbeing, decreasing workplace violations, and decreasing environmental noncompliance. This can lead to lower fines potentially improving profits.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The downsides of increasing safety and environmental quality come from the cost of the equipment decreasing profits and the lower profitable working hours from more time being spent in training. This can harm profits if the costs outweigh the gains of the safety and environmental protection.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The 2018 approval of the BHP south flank iron ore mine required a large investment in dust suppression, water management, and habitat offsetting. This required large initial capital however it ensured compliance and improved the environment around the mine.</span></p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Strategy 3: Technology and automation investment</h2>
      <div class="strategy">
        <p><span class="blank">Technology and automation investment is the act of decreasing human reliance on production and maintenance by introducing advanced machinery, autonomous vehicles, and computerised systems into mining operations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The benefits of investing in technology and automation are increasing productivity, lowering long term costs, and improving safety by reducing the need for workers to be exposed to dangerous tasks. This can also lead to more consistent production outcomes and higher efficiency across large scale operations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">The downsides of technology and automation investment are the very high upfront capital costs required to purchase, install, and maintain these systems, along with the potential for job losses and community backlash when human roles are replaced by machines. There is also the risk that over reliance on automated systems can create vulnerabilities if the technology fails or requires specialised maintenance.</span></p>
        <p><span class="blank">In the Pilbara region, BHP introduced autonomous haul trucks and drills, which reduced operating costs and improved safety, but required large investment and led to concerns about reduced local employment opportunities.</span></p>
