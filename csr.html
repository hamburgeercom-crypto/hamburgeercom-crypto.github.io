        <h2>Social dimension</h2>
        <p>Social dimension: Introduced as part of BHP’s broader sustainability commitments, the social dimension of CSR focuses on improving the wellbeing of communities where the company operates. The positive effects include strengthening Indigenous partnerships, improving education outcomes, and supporting health services in regional areas. The negative effects are the high costs of maintaining these programs and the long term commitments that may not directly increase company profits. Case study example: In 2025, BHP invested 31.8 million dollars in Indigenous social projects, including 9.4 million dollars in community health and wellbeing and 5 million dollars in education and training, showing how CSR improves community relationships with the company but adds to company costs.</p>

        <h2>Economic dimension</h2>
        <p>Economic dimension: The economic dimension of CSR shows BHP’s role in creating jobs and supporting regional community growth. The positive effects are stabilising communities economies, giving apprenticeships to young people, and building a skilled workforce. The negative effects are the high costs of training programs and reduced short term profitability. Case study example: BHP’s FutureFit Academy invested 300 million dollars over five years, training more than 2,500 people since 2020, with 50,000 Australians trained or reskilled in 2024, demonstrating how CSR builds long term economic progress while requiring significant financial investment.</p>

      <h2>Environmental dimension</h2>
      <p>Environmental dimension: The environmental dimension of CSR ensures mining balances profit with environmental sustainability. The positive effects include protecting local wildlife, reducing emissions from mining operations, and improving BHP’s reputation as a trustworthy mining company. The negative effects are the costs of staying compliant, planning and managing rehabilitation projects, and changing energy sources to come from renewable methods. Case study example: BHP has committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 30% by 2030 and already achieving a 32% reduction by 2023 through renewable energy transition, showing how CSR improves sustainability of a company but increases running costs.</p>
