    <h1>Government Policies Affecting BHP</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Government Policy 1</h2>
      <p>Policy: Mining royalties. Introduced in 1906, the Mining royalties policy was implemented to give the state a return on extracted resources to increase the governments expendable capital for redistribution to various government agencies, by adding a taxation on profits from selling ore which was usually set around the 5% mark.</p>
      <p>Positive effect: Two positive effects of mining royalties are to provide governments with revenue to fund public schools and hospitals, and allowing the community to benefit from the expenditure of its natural resources.</p>
      <p>Negative effect: The main negative effects of mining royalties are reducing mining profit margins in a volatile industry leading to the company being at higher risk of bankruptcy and the higher costs making the company less competitive than import companies with lower royalties.</p>
      <p>Case study example: In september 2025, BHP announced that it would cut 750 jobs at Saraji south coal mine, blaming the state's increased coal royalties making the mine financially unviable.</p>

      <h2>Government Policy 2</h2>
      <p>Policy: Environmental approvals. Introduced in 1999, the Environmental protection and biodiversity conservation act was created as a full encompassing system for any environmentally related project. The act determines that companies must go environmental assessment before projects can proceed, and approvals can require monitoring on the projects, along with having limits on what the company can produce and pollute.</p>
      <p>Positive effect: The primary benefits of environmental protection is to benefit the health and livelihood of those who live in the community where a company operates, along with protecting wildlife like plants and animals.</p>
      <p>Negative effect: The main downsides that a company must deal with is the financial and work related aspects of the monitoring and the limits, requiring expensive measurement gear, high administrative fees from the EPA and managing workers to maintain this equipment along with researching methods to staying within the limits of the environmental protection license.</p>
      <p>Case study example: In 2018, BHP proposed to open a new iron mine in western australia, and the conditions of opening the mine as dictated by the DCCEEW included offsetting habitats for threatened species and the monitoring of the mine's effects on local groundwater.</p>

      <h2>Government Policy 3</h2>
      <p>Policy: Workplace safety laws. Introduced in 2009, the Fair work act and Work health and safety laws set employment conditions, safety standards and protection against unfair treatment. This requires companies to introduce safety training, Personal Protective Equipment investment and automated payment systems to stay compliant.</p>
      <p>Positive effect: The positive effects of this policy was improving workplace safety, making mining far less dangerous than early australian mining by improving lifespan of workers, decreasing health complications and decreasing death rate, also as a result potentially decreasing staff turnover.</p>
      <p>Negative effect: The negative effects of this policy mainly affected the companies, increasing the cost of staying compliant, requiring PPE investment, safety training, and increasing the total cost of employee maintenance.</p>
      <p>Case study example: In july 2025, the Fair work commission ruled that BHP must reclassify over 2000 coal mine workers under the 'Same job for the same pay' laws, costing BHP 66 million dollars annually.</p>
